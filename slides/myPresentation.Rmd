## Abstract

Drivers that circulate inside cities in Portugal have a maximum speed limit of 50 km/h, but the behaviour is not always in compliance with the law.
After observing the possibility of high speeds in the road *Avenida Almirante Gago Coutinho* in *Mem-Martins*, *Sintra*, *Portugal*, the vehicle speed was measured with a **Raspberry Pi Zero W** and an exploratory data analysis was performed in **R**.
It was verified that the vehicles moving from *Mem-Martins* to *Sintra* had a mean speed of **69 km/h** and from *Sintra* to *Mem-Martins* had a mean speed of **87 km/h**
This road have a pedestrian crossing about 40 meters after the experimental measuring local, and two schools and a sports hall nearby that encourage the presence of many pedestrians in the sidewalk of this road.

## Data acquisition

Data was acquired in August 2020.   
Details of the hardware setup can seen in the repository of this project in [VascoRibeiroPereira/carspeed.py](https://github.com/VascoRibeiroPereira/carspeed.py).

## Exploratory Data analysis

Detailed information in [Project website](https://vascoribeiropereira.github.io/carspeed.py/).

```{r }

library(ggplot2) 
library(dplyr) 
library(lubridate) 
library(plotly) 

my_wd <- getwd()
filesList <- list.files("~/R/carspeed/RawData")

setwd("~/R/carspeed/RawData")

carspeed <- tibble()
for (i in 1:length(filesList)) {
        tmp<- read.csv(filesList[i])   
        
        carspeed <- rbind(tmp, carspeed)
}

carspeed$Direction <- as.factor(carspeed$Direction)
carspeed_Clean <- filter(carspeed, Speed < 120 & Speed > 10)
carspeed_Clean <- carspeed_Clean[,-2]
carspeed_Clean <- mutate(carspeed_Clean, valid = paste(Date, Time, sep = " "))
carspeed_Clean <- carspeed_Clean[,-c(1,2)]

carspeed_Clean$valid <- parse_date_time(carspeed_Clean$valid, "Ymd HM", tz="Europe/Lisbon")
carspeed_Clean$valid <- round_date(carspeed_Clean$valid, unit = "hour")

## As medições foram sistematizadas apenas a partir de dia 2020-08-03
carspeed_filter <- filter(carspeed_Clean, valid >= as.Date("2020-08-03"))

groupedData <- carspeed_filter %>% group_by(valid, Direction)
speed_Analysis <- groupedData %>% summarise(meanSpeed = mean(Speed))


speed_Analysis$Direction <- as.integer(speed_Analysis$Direction)

for(i in 1:length(speed_Analysis$Direction)) {
        if (speed_Analysis$Direction[i] == 1) speed_Analysis$Direction[i] <- "Sintra-MemMartins" 
        else speed_Analysis$Direction[i] <- "MemMartins-Sintra"
        }

speed_Analysis$Direction <- as.factor(speed_Analysis$Direction)

Date_Measured <- speed_Analysis$valid
Direction <- speed_Analysis$Direction
Speed <- speed_Analysis$meanSpeed

df <- tibble(Date_Measured, Direction, Speed)

```

The cleaned data have this appearance:
```{r, echo = TRUE,  include = TRUE}

knitr::kable(head(df,3))

``` 

## Data Plot

```{r, echo = FALSE, include= TRUE}

gp <- ggplot(data = df, 
             mapping = aes(x = Date_Measured, y = Speed, color = Direction)) + 
        geom_point(alpha = 1/2)

gg <- ggplotly(gp)

gg

```

## Data Summary

```{r, echo = TRUE,  include = TRUE, comment="" }

summary(filter(df, Direction == 'MemMartins-Sintra')$Speed)

```

```{r, echo = TRUE,  include = TRUE, comment="" }

summary(filter(df, Direction == 'Sintra-MemMartins')$Speed)

```

## Conclusion

The possibility of high speeds in the road *Avenida Almirante Gago Coutinho* was confirmed with maximum speeds of **117 km/h** which is a crime in this location.   
The mean speed in both directions are above the permitted velocity - **69 km/h** and **87 km/h**.   
It is highly recommended the imposition of preventive measures such as speed bumps.
